# EXCEL-DASHBORAD
Most people think Excel is just for rows and columns. I decided to push it further.  I recently built this Adventure Works SalesDashboard to bridge the gap between complex data &amp;clear decision-making. By using advanced Pivot modeling and Neumorphic design principles,I turned over18,000 customer data points into a scannable, interactive experience.
